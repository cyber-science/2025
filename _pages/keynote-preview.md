<b>Abstract: </b> Using LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites is an effective approach to provide network connectivity in areas where terrestrial infrastructure cannot be deployed. LEO satellites offer wide coverage, low power consumption, low latency, and high-capacity communication. However, LEO satellites have a drawback: low uplink throughput, which becomes a bottleneck when delivering large-size content from ground-based servers via LEO satellites. To address this problem, deploying caches on LEO satellites is an effective solution, allowing content delivery directly from the satellite caches. In this talk, I will explain issues on cache distribution from LEO satellite and approaches to solve these issues.
