<b>Abstract: </b> Using LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites is an effective approach to provide network connectivity in areas where terrestrial infrastructure cannot be deployed. LEO satellites offer wide coverage, low power consumption, low latency, and high-capacity communication. However, LEO satellites have a drawback: low uplink throughput, which becomes a bottleneck when delivering large-size content from ground-based servers via LEO satellites. To address this problem, deploying caches on LEO satellites is an effective solution, allowing content delivery directly from the satellite caches. In this talk, I will explain issues on cache distribution from LEO satellite and approaches to solve these issues.

<b>Abstract: </b>The cybersecurity issues of 6G networks and Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) are challenging for traditional centralized defense techniques to handle. This keynote introduces a UK-Japan partnership that combines neuromorphic AI, federated learning, and O-RAN edge deployment for near-real-time, privacy-preserving malware detection. We address privacy issues, data heterogeneity, and communication delay in federated learning with our new FedAvgVChang algorithm. In running 20 rounds, the system achieves 96.8% detection accuracy, which is 38% faster than normal federated averaging. It is tested on the CIC IoT 2023 dataset and a synthetic IoT dataset that mimics CIC IoT 2023 with simulated attack scenarios (e.g., Mirai, DDoS). On normal hardware, it achieves a median inference delay of 0.15 seconds; on neuromorphic platforms (emulated Loihi), it can achieve inference times of less than 0.8 seconds. Strong detection across a variety of attack vectors is demonstrated by performance indicators such as a global F1-score of 0.968, AUC of 0.974, precision of 0.966, and recall of 0.970. This work validates the viability of scalable, privacy-conscious threat detection in synthetic edge and O-RAN sandbox scenarios. The presentation covers system design, performance metrics, collaborative roadmap, and future goals for federated neuromorphic security in forthcoming global 6G ecosystems.

<b>Abstract: </b>Software dependability encompasses five critical properties: reliability, safety, integrity, availability, and maintainability. Ensuring these attributes throughout the software engineering process remains a significant and ongoing challenge. In this talk, I will begin by briefly outlining a general framework for developing dependable software. I will then focus on an advanced technique known as Testing-Based Formal Verification (TBFV), which integrates specification-based testing with formal methods to verify program correctness. TBFV is characterized by its ability to automatically verify the correctness of all program paths explored during testing, while also having the potential to uncover previously untested paths. This dual capability supports both validation and verification, enhancing the overall assurance of software quality. I will explain the core principles of TBFV, specific techniques it employs for fault prevention, validation, and verification, as well as the key challenges associated with its practical implementation. When fully realized, TBFV is expected to significantly reduce testing time and cost, and substantially improve software dependability.
