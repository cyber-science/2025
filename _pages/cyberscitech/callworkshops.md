<h3>Call For Workshops and Special Sessions - IEEE CyberSciTech 2025</h3>
<hr/>

IEEE CyberSciTech 2025 invites Workshops and Special Sessions (SS) to enrich and broaden the research focus of the main conference. 
The purpose is to provide opportunities for focused discussions on selected topics that will not be fully explored during the main event, 
as well as to encourage in-depth discussion of technical and application issues related to cyberspace-related science, technology, and application topics. 
Workshops and Special Sessions are a great addition to the main conference.
<br/>



The proposal should contain the following information:<br/>
- The title of the Workshop/SS, including both full name and acronym 
- A brief technical description of the Workshop/SS, identification of specific technical issues, focus, and justification of how timely the workshop is 
- A brief description of the review process (including the expected number of accepted papers)
- One-page CFP of the Workshop/SS, including the submission deadline and notification date (according to the dates established for the main conference)
- Brief plans for dissemination (e.g., how to advertise the Workshop/SS or possible submissions to special issues of journals), and the expected number of participants
- History of the workshop (if any)
- Names and contact information of the organizers
- A tentative website/URL of the proposed Workshop/SS (optional)

Acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the Workshop/SS topic, its relevance to the main conference, the expected audience, and the proposer's ability to lead a successful workshop. 
<br/>

The organizers and chairs of each accepted Workshop/SS shall have full control on the call for papers, composing the program committee, managing the review and selection of papers as well as planning the workshop program. 
The review and selection of workshop papers should follow similar approaches used in the main conference. The conference organizers and not the workshop organizers will determine the registration fees for workshops. 
The fees will be paid to the conference, and the conference will provide workshop facilities including the meeting room, proceedings and conference attendance delegation for the Workshop/SS day. 
<br/>

The proceedings of the IEEE CyberSciTech 2025 workshops will be published by Conference Publishing Services and included in the proceedings of IEEE CyberSciTech 2025. 
<br/>
