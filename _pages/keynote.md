<b>Abstract: </b> Modern distributed systems also deal with uncertain scenarios, where environments, infrastructures, and applications are widely diverse. In the scope of IoT-Edge-Fog-Cloud computing, leveraging these neuroscience-inspired principles and mechanisms could aid in building more flexible solutions able to generalize over different environments. A captivating set of hypotheses from the field of neuroscience suggests that human and animal brain mechanisms result from a few powerful principles. If proved to be accurate, these assumptions could open a deep understanding of the way humans and animals manage to cope with the unpredictability of events and imagination.

<b>Abstract: </b> Japan entered a super-aged society [percentage of old people (≥ 65 yrs old) ≥ 21%] in 2005. Nowadays, the aging problem in Japan is very serious. As a measure to cope with aging, research related to assistive robots has been widely carried out. In this talk, I will explain how we process physiological and motor signals and make full use of them to build control systems for the assistive robots we have developed, using examples of an electric trolley, a left-right independent treadmill, and a sit-to-stand assistive machine.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Abstract: </b> Cities are the fundamental units of a country’s functioning, and in developing nations, building smart cities requires carefully curated infrastructure that aligns with local needs and available resources. This talk examines critical metrics often overlooked in urban growth planning and presents a simple, yet universally applicable agent-based mechanism to capture the emergent properties of growing cities. This approach is relevant to both developing and advanced economies, offering unifying insights into their seemingly complex dynamics. Additionally, the talk explores the interplay between migration, wealth movement, and urban development. While migration dynamics in advanced economies can be effectively modeled using the radiation model or by mathematically analyzing work opportunities and a region’s relative attractiveness compared to its neighbors, we demonstrate that low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) require a more nuanced approach. Factors such as education systems and local amenities must be mathematically incorporated into the radiation model to improve predictive accuracy. Furthermore, I will discuss the unique opportunities LMICs present in understanding causation principles within urban settings, particularly in areas such as pollution diffusion, traffic congestion, and the artificially inflated carrying capacities caused by intermittent tourism. I aim to demonstrate how data science and AI-driven approaches can be effectively used to formulate quantifiable policies that strike an optimal balance between cost-efficiency and urban convenience in rapidly growing cities.

<b>Abstract: </b> Knowledge representations and interactions are at the forefront of teaching, learning, and career planning activities in all endeavors of education and career development. University students are increasingly faced with a myriad of interdisciplinary topics that are seemingly unrelated when unstructured knowledge representations are presented, especially during advising and career orientation sessions. This is especially challenging in fast-changing technical domains such as Computer and Data Science where university curricula are reviewed on an annual basis. This makes it increasingly difficult for instructors and administrators to present both the big picture as well as the detailed knowledge components of degree programs to students when choosing a career or establishing a plan of study and assessment. This paper introduces the KCUBE project, a virtual reality knowledge graph framework for structuring and presenting both the overall view of the Computer Science curriculum taught in the Department of Computing at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University as well as the scheduling alternatives in managing course content and presentation views by instructors and students. We employ computational information storage and retrieval methods, machine learning, and interactive virtual reality to better understand, manipulate, and visualize abstract concepts and relationships in the development of teaching and learning activities in our department.
