Over the last fifty years, computational intelligence has evolved from artificial intelligence, nature-inspired computing, and social-oriented technology to cyber-physical integrated ubiquitous intelligence towards Pervasive Intelligence (PI). The IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing is intended to cover all kinds of these intelligent paradigms as well as their applications in various pervasive computing domains. PICom 2025 is the conference on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, previously held as PCC (Las Vegas, USA, 2003 and 2004), PSC (Las Vegas, USA, 2005), PCAC (Vienna, Austria, 2006, and Niagara Falls, Canada, 2007), IPC-2007 (Jeju, Korea, December 2007), IPC-2008 (Sydney, Australia, December 2008), and since 2009 as the name PICom. It aims to bring together computer scientists and engineers, providing a platform for vibrant discussions and exchanges on experimental and theoretical results, ongoing work, cutting-edge designs, and innovative test-environments or testbeds, while also delving into the latest advancements and novel trends in Intelligence and Machine Learning within the realms of Pervasive Intelligence and Computing.
