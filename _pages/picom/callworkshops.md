PICom 2025 invites Workshops (WSs) and Special Sessions (SSs) to enrich and broaden the research focus of the main conference. The purpose is to facilitate focused discussions on key and timely topics related to Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, encompassing both technical and application-related challenges. However, the scope is not limited to these areas, allowing for a broader exploration of emerging trends and innovations. Workshops and Special Sessions are a great addition to the main conference.
<br/>

The proposal should contain the following information:<br/>
- The title of the WS/SS, including both full name and acronym 
- A brief technical description of the WS /SS, identification of specific technical issues, focus, and justification of how timely the workshop is
- A brief description of the review process (including the expected number of accepted papers)
- One-page CFP of the WS/SS, including the submission deadline and notification date (according to the dates established for the main conference)
- Brief plans for dissemination (e.g., how to advertise the WS/SS or possible submissions to special issues of journals) and the expected number of participants
- History of the workshop (if any)
- Names and contact information of the organizers
- A tentative website/URL of the proposed WS/SS (optional)

Acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the WS/SS topic, its relevance to the main conference, the expected audience, and the proposer’s ability to lead a successful workshop.  
<br/>

The organizers and chairs of each accepted WS/SS will create its call for papers, compose the program committee, manage the review and selection of papers, as well as plan the workshop program. The review and selection of workshop papers should follow similar approaches used in the main conference. The conference organizers will determine the registration fees for workshops. The fees will be paid to the conference, and the conference will provide workshop facilities, including the meeting room, proceedings, and conference attendance delegation for the WS/SS Day. 
<br/>

The proceedings of the PICom 2025 workshops will be published and included in the proceedings of PICom 2025.  
<br/>
