To commemorate the centenary anniversary of Alan Turing’s birthday, the Open Forum on Top 10 Questions on Intelligent Informatics/Computing (<a href="https://wi-consortium.org/blog/top10qi/" target=_new><b><u>Top10Qi</u></b></a>) was held in the World Intelligence Congress, Macau, 2012. Inspired by the profound question “*Can machines think?*” raised by Turing in 1950, the Top10Qi forum was conducted by first calling for questions from the crowd worldwide, then voting for top 10 questions from the 128 collected questions, and finally holding an interactive panel for the announcement and heated discussion on the top 10 voted questions. 

Among the questions solicited in Top10Qi, some questions including “*What are the most promising solutions and techniques to build real commercial intelligent systems?*” have been partially answered thanks to swift and significant progress, especially LLM (Large Language Model) and GAI/GenAI as well as associative dialogue tools initiated from ChatGPT. In the unprecedented AI boom, LLM has been the core due to its learning ability by leveraging enormous data and supercomputing powers. Nowadays, other forms of LM (Large Model) have emerged, to name a few, VLM (Vision Language Model), LMM (Large Multimodal Model), and LRM (Large Reasoning Model). The term **xLM** collectively refers to various kinds of large models, both emerged and to emerge. 

Some questions voted among the top 10, such as “*Can machines be creative?*” and “*Will computers replace human thinking?*”, are imaginative and even deeply philosophical. These questions are, to some extent, also related to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Elon Musk has claimed that Grok 4 can discover new technologies and physics in the near future. Is it possible or not to make such imagination-like cAI (Creative AI), tAI (Thinking AI), even super or hyper AI? It is also one of fundamental themes under explorations by the IEEE SC Technical Committee on Hyper-Intelligence (<a href="https://ieee-hyperintelligence.org/" target=_new><b><u>HITC</u></b></a>). The term **yAI** encompasses diverse AI forms, from widely discussed AGI to highly specialized HyperAI. 

A few TopQi questions like “*Can machines and the people think together?*” have been positively responded thanks to LLM and GAI based technologies and application tools including ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DeepSeek, etc. Related intelligent technologies such as Agentic AI, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Context Engineering, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) are rapidly emerging. Numerous applications are appearing, penetrating and pervading almost every aspect in the world, from daily life, education and entertainment to work, research and development. The term **zTech** refers broadly to innovative technologies and rich applications enabled by xLM and yAI. 

This **XYZ panel**, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the term ‘Artificial Intelligence,’ is designed as an insightful platform for distinguished experts to share their perspectives surrounding xLM, yAI, and zTech. Participants will exchange ideas, and collaboratively envision the future trajectory of artificial intelligence.

<b>Abstract: </b>Recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the areas of xLMs and yAI, have attracted considerable attention with regard to technological performance. However, the more critical question for businesses and society is how these advances can be transformed into sustainable value. 
<br/>
From a business research perspective, the emphasis will be placed on both the opportunities and risks inherent in this field. The discussion will encompass the potential for value creation, organisational adaptation, and responsible governance to shape AI's long-term contribution to society. By shifting the focus from performance metrics to value-oriented implementation, we can enhance our understanding of how AI can drive sustainable business impact while fostering a more balanced coexistence between technology and human society.
