<b>Abstract: </b> Modern distributed systems also deal with uncertain scenarios, where environments, infrastructures, and applications are widely diverse. In the scope of IoT-Edge-Fog-Cloud computing, leveraging these neuroscience-inspired principles and mechanisms could aid in building more flexible solutions able to generalize over different environments. A captivating set of hypotheses from the field of neuroscience suggests that human and animal brain mechanisms result from a few powerful principles. If proved to be accurate, these assumptions could open a deep understanding of the way humans and animals manage to cope with the unpredictability of events and imagination.

<b>Abstract: </b> Japan entered a super-aged society [percentage of old people (≥ 65 yrs old) ≥ 21%] in 2005. Nowadays, the aging problem in Japan is very serious. As a measure to cope with aging, research related to assistive robots has been widely carried out. In this talk, I will explain how we process physiological and motor signals and make full use of them to build control systems for the assistive robots we have developed, using examples of an electric trolley, a left-right independent treadmill, and a sit-to-stand assistive machine.

<b>Abstract: </b> Cities are the fundamental units of a country’s functioning, and in developing nations, building smart cities requires carefully curated infrastructure that aligns with local needs and available resources. This talk examines critical metrics often overlooked in urban growth planning and presents a simple, yet universally applicable agent-based mechanism to capture the emergent properties of growing cities. This approach is relevant to both developing and advanced economies, offering unifying insights into their seemingly complex dynamics. Additionally, the talk explores the interplay between migration, wealth movement, and urban development. While migration dynamics in advanced economies can be effectively modeled using the radiation model or by mathematically analyzing work opportunities and a region’s relative attractiveness compared to its neighbors, we demonstrate that low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) require a more nuanced approach. Factors such as education systems and local amenities must be mathematically incorporated into the radiation model to improve predictive accuracy. Furthermore, I will discuss the unique opportunities LMICs present in understanding causation principles within urban settings, particularly in areas such as pollution diffusion, traffic congestion, and the artificially inflated carrying capacities caused by intermittent tourism. I aim to demonstrate how data science and AI-driven approaches can be effectively used to formulate quantifiable policies that strike an optimal balance between cost-efficiency and urban convenience in rapidly growing cities.
